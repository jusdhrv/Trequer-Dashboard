# Fix Badge Import in Sidebar Component

## Overview

Fixed a type error in the Vercel build process where the Badge component was not being recognized due to incorrect import paths. The fix involved updating import paths to use absolute paths with the Next.js `@` alias instead of relative paths.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Update Badge Import Path

#### Implementation

```typescript
// Before
import { Badge } from "./ui/badge";

// After
import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/badge";
```

#### Purpose

- Fixed type error preventing successful Vercel build
- Aligned import paths with Next.js best practices
- Improved code maintainability with consistent import patterns

### 2. Update Related UI Component Imports

#### Implementation

```typescript
// Before
import { cn } from "../lib/utils";
import { toast } from "./ui/use-toast";

// After
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
import { toast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast";
```

#### Purpose

- Ensured consistency across all UI-related imports
- Prevented potential similar issues with other components
- Made the codebase more maintainable with standardized import paths

## Testing Considerations

- Verify successful Vercel build completion
- Check Badge component rendering in the Inbox section
- Ensure unread count functionality works as expected
- Confirm other UI components continue to function properly

## Future Considerations

1. Consider adding ESLint rule to enforce consistent import paths
2. Review and update other components for similar import patterns
3. Document import path conventions in the project guidelines
4. Consider adding import path verification to CI/CD pipeline
